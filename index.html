    <p class = 'project-intro1'>What would your life be like if you were wrongly convicted of murder and then freed, maybe years later? That's the experience of nearly 800 people who have been exonerated from murder between 1989 and March 2017 in the United States. On average, those 779 people waited 14 years to be freed. One person was struggling in the wrongful conviction for 59 years. Without a doubt, their lives are no longer the same.</p><br>
    <p class = 'project-intro1'>The data on exonerations was collected by <a href = 'http://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/about.aspx' target='_blank'>The National Registry of Exonerations</a> project. According to the project, someone is exonerated when a person who has been convicted of a crime is officially cleared.</p>
